  Keyboard matrix device GPIO column drive

  This can be used to handle a specific keyboard matrix column using a GPIO.
  Instantiate as a child node of the keyboard matrix device itself.

  Example configuration:

  &kbd {
      ...
      kso-gpio {
          compatible = "ite,col-gpio-drive";
          col-num = <16>;
          col-gpios = <&gpioa 0 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
      };
  };

compatible: "ite,col-gpio-drive"

include: base.yaml

properties:
  col-num:
    type: int
    required: true
    description: Column number to handle

  col-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: GPIO to use to handle the column

  settle-time-us:
    type: int
    default: 30

      Extra delay after changing the column state, note that this adds up to
      the parent device settle-time-us.
